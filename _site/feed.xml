This is my first experience into prop making.  I’ve selected parts based on price and general shape of what existed in the actual prop.  The basic parts consist of a tin box, pvc elbows, an ethernet cable, an led strip, and an Arduino Uno.  I painted the pvc elbows with bronze and red to mimic the brass risers and the cable covers.  Then, I cut the ethernet cable into short pieces and fit them into the end of the elbows.  After that, I soldered some wire onto my led strips and assembled the face of my flux capacitor.  After assembling the face, I cut a small hole into the side of the tin box and snapped a power switch into place.  Finally, I fit the battery pack which holds 4 AA batteries and the Arduino into the box and set the face on top of those.  Everything is held in place after the lid is closed.&lt;/p&gt;

This is my first attempt at making jewelry, so I decided to create my own version of one of my favorite rings from the Dark Souls series.  I made this ring while taking a jewelry metalsmithing class at my local art center.  I used half-round silver wire and cut a herring bone pattern on the top of the wire then bent it to shape.  I then balled and shaped the head and finished the piece by oxidizing and giving a light sanding.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">“A silver ring depicting a snake that could have been, but never was, a dragon.

This game was made as part of a 48 hour game jam in which the game was to be based on a song or lyric of our choice. We based our game on ‘Full Steam Spacemachine’ by Royal Republic and we placed 3rd. We built this game to be played on the Oculus Rift and a custom arcade panel. It can, however also be played with mouse/keyboard or an Xbox controller.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Terrorize the galaxy in your Spacemachine by shooting down any opposition you face.
