&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use a series of raycasts to determine if there is an adjacent track.  If there is no adjacent track, the connecting piece in that direction remains hidden.  I also added logic to determine if the adjacent track is facing toward the current track.  This prevents tracks from having a connection when neither track points to the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I default the starting position of the camera to the middle of the selected level and set bounds based on the max and min X and Z positions of level tiles.  This lets me design rooms wwith more variance in size and shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initial win condition is an easy one.  The player simply needs to sacrifice all chickens dispensed from the pipe.  Eventually, I’ll add more complex win conditions, but for now I just want to finish the main game state loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After creating the load menu and system, I can pick a level to load from all available level files.  After creating a level in the editor I build in the previous episode, it can be loaded by the game.  These systems will allow me to quickly add more content and easily navigate all of the game’s challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
