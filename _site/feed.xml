This is my first attempt at making jewelry, so I decided to create my own version of one of my favorite rings from the Dark Souls series.  I made this ring while taking a jewelry metalsmithing class at my local art center.  I used half-round silver wire and cut a herring bone pattern on the top of the wire then bent it to shape.  I then balled and shaped the head and finished the piece by oxidizing and giving a light sanding.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Fallen foes yield more souls.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Full Steam Space Pixel</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/projects/games/full-steam-space-pixel" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Full Steam Space Pixel" /><published>2016-03-20T16:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2016-03-20T16:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/projects/games/full-steam-space-pixel</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/projects/games/full-steam-space-pixel">&lt;p&gt;Fight your way through peace loving space police and take their technology to improve your own space ship.

Based on Full Steam Space Machine (developed for a 48 hour game jam), this is my retro reimaging of the game.

This game was made as part of a 48 hour game jam in which the game was to be based on a song or lyric of our choice. We based our game on ‘Full Steam Spacemachine’ by Royal Republic and we placed 3rd. We built this game to be played on the Oculus Rift and a custom arcade panel. It can, however also be played with mouse/keyboard or an Xbox controller.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Terrorize the galaxy in your Spacemachine by shooting down any opposition you face.

Although this game never left the prototype stage, we had fun using Unreal Engine 4. We decided to move to another project when we discovered the networking was not built for what we needed. We also discovered that Unreal’s documentation and forums need some serious work to be of any use to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Lead your Legion to victory by controlling the map, and therefore, your enemy.
