&lt;!-- more --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After creating the load menu and system, I can pick a level to load from all available level files.  After creating a level in the editor I build in the previous episode, it can be loaded by the game.  These systems will allow me to quickly add more content and easily navigate all of the game’s challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use Unity and Visual Studio Code.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Twain</name></author><summary type="html">I make a level selection menu and a level load system that will serve as the level hub for the entire game.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Level Editing</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/updates/games/snackrificial-chamber-level-editing" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Level Editing" /><published>2019-02-19T16:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2019-02-19T16:00:00-06:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/updates/games/snackrificial-chamber-level-editing</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/updates/games/snackrificial-chamber-level-editing">&lt;p&gt;I make an editor to help speed up the design and creation of levels using a custom editor in Unity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this editor, I can place, rotate, and delete tiles to create a level.  After the level is designed, I can then save it to a specified folder and file name as an xml file.  This file can also be loaded in order to edit the level and eventually build it in game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve been tasked with solving the logistics problems of a local cult and their snack factory.  It’s your job to fix the conveyor belts and prepare the chickens for consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game was initiall created for Ludum Dare 43 under the theme of ‘Sacrifices Must be Made’.  I decided to rebuild the game for mobile while fixing some of the issues that came up due to creating the game in a limited timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mark Twain</name></author><summary type="html">Not sure how, but you managed to get yourself roped in with a cult led by the greatest snackers in history.
