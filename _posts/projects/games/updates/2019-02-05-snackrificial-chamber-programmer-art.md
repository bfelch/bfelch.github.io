I continue the remake by creating new models for the chicken, conveyor belt, and ritual circle as well as creating floor and wall tiles.

These models replace all of the placeholder art created in the previous episode.

I use a combination of MagicaVoxel, Photoshop, and remapped UVs to create the models I need for my game.
