I add the ability to pan the camera, allowing for more freedom in designing levels.

<!-- more -->

I default the starting position of the camera to the middle of the selected level and set bounds based on the max and min X and Z positions of level tiles.  This lets me design rooms wwith more variance in size and shape.

I use Unity and Visual Studio Code.
