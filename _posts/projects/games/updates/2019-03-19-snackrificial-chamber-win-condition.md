I add a basic win condition that requires all chickens to be sacrificed so a level can end and a new one selected.

<!-- more -->

The initial win condition is an easy one.  The player simply needs to sacrifice all chickens dispensed from the pipe.  Eventually, I'll add more complex win conditions, but for now I just want to finish the main game state loop.

I use Unity and Visual Studio Code.
