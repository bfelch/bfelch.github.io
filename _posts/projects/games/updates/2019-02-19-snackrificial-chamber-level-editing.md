I make an editor to help speed up the design and creation of levels using a custom editor in Unity.

<!-- more -->

With this editor, I can place, rotate, and delete tiles to create a level.  After the level is designed, I can then save it to a specified folder and file name as an xml file.  This file can also be loaded in order to edit the level and eventually build it in game.

I use Unity and Visual Studio Code to create the editor.
