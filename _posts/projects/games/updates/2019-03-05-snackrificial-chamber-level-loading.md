I make a level selection menu and a level load system that will serve as the level hub for the entire game.

<!-- more -->

After creating the load menu and system, I can pick a level to load from all available level files.  After creating a level in the editor I build in the previous episode, it can be loaded by the game.  These systems will allow me to quickly add more content and easily navigate all of the game's challenges.

I use Unity and Visual Studio Code.
