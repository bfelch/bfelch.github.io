I add track placement so the player can solve levels and progress through the game.

<!-- more -->

I get the position of the clicked tile, then check to see if there is an object on top of the tile.  If there is no object on the tile, a new track is placed and selected.  If there is a track on the tile, it is simply selected.  I then add the ability to rotate track pieces to complete player controls.

I use Unity and Visual Studio Code.
