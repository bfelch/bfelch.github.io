Not sure how, but you managed to get yourself roped in with a cult led by the greatest snackers in history.  Please the Great Ones by preparing their favorite dish.  But be careful, if you don't meet their requirements you'll have to do it again.

Happy snacking!

You've been tasked with solving the logistics problems of a local cult and their snack factory.  It's your job to fix the conveyor belts and prepare the chickens for consumption.

This game was initially created for Ludum Dare 43 under the theme of 'Sacrifices Must be Made'.  I decided to rebuild the game for mobile while fixing some of the issues that came up due to creating the game in a limited timeframe.
